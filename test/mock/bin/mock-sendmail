# This script is intended to be used to "mock out" the 'sendmail' binary when running the
# test suite. This so, when the PHP 'mail' function is called, no actual attempt will be
# made to send an email. The email message passed to this script is then chucked into the
# database so assertions can be made be client test cases to make sure an email was "sent"
# and that it had the expected characeteristics (subject, recipient, etc).

# TODO: Store messages somewhere for retrieval by test API...
